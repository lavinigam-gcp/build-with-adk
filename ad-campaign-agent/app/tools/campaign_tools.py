"""Campaign management tools for CRUD operations.

Product-Centric Model:
    Each campaign is tied to a single product at a single store location.
    Example: "Blue Floral Maxi Dress - Westfield Century City"

    This allows:
    - Clear metrics attribution per product per location
    - A/B testing with variations for the same product
    - Same product at different stores = different campaigns
