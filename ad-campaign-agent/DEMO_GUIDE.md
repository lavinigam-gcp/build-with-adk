## Demo Tips

1. **Wait for video generation**: Veo 3.1 takes 2-5 minutes. Use this time to explain the process or show other features.

2. **Check artifacts**: After generating videos/images/charts, remind viewers they can see them in the ADK Web UI artifacts panel.

3. **Use natural language**: The agent understands context. You don't need exact command syntax.

4. **Build on previous responses**: Reference "the top performer" or "that campaign" - the agent maintains context.

5. **Show the handoff**: Point out when the coordinator delegates to specialized agents.

6. **Highlight the data**: All mock metrics are realistic with 90 days of history per campaign.

7. **Video properties are auto-extracted**: Every video is automatically analyzed after generation to extract mood, energy, style, and 25+ other properties. Show this by asking "Get video properties for ad X" after generating.

8. **Property-controlled generation**: Demonstrate fine-grained control by requesting specific mood (quirky, warm, bold), energy (calm, dynamic), colors (warm, cool), and lighting (dramatic, natural). The system builds templated prompts from these properties.
